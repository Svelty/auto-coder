ok, so currently in the agentRunner I register all my tools and then pass the prompt to the agent




need rest api 

need to create "tool sets" which can be given to an agent

tool set defines the agent

so for example: jira agent will need the jira toolset

maybe sub agents will be behind a manager agent

i guess a rest api other than the "chat" interface which will be used to interact with the agent should have other endpoints for collecting data 




so how does this work? I say, Hi bot i would like to start a new ticket



ok i guess i need to define the parts here first:

manager bot: main chat interface

jira agent:

coding agent:

review agent:

build and merge:



i think the key part here is to get specific with the tools, define a limited domain in which the agent will work
instead of building a general coding agent we can try to build an agent that focuses on one 
constraints, how constrained is an agent, can they edit any file or do they only work in one module?
what can we gain out of making extreemly specific tools?

how would i go about running multiple agents at once?
